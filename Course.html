<h3> JAVA </h3>
<p> Java Virtual Machine (JVM): JVM is an engine that provides a runtime environment to drive the Java code or applications. It is the center of the programming language and performs the operation of converting Java bytecode into machine language. It provides numerous libraries, frameworks, and tools. <br> 

Java Runtime Environment (JRE): JRE is a runtime environment that is required to execute Java programs and applications. If a user wants to run a Java program in their machine, they must have JRE installed on the machine. It’s platform dependent, meaning the JRE installed must be compatible with the user’s operating system and architecture. <br>

Java Development Kit (JDK): JDK is the core component of the Java environment. It contains JRE along with Java compiler, Java debugger, and other classes. It’s used for Java development to provide the entire executables and binaries as well as the tools to compile and debug a Java program. <br>

BENEFITS OF JAVA
Java is easy to learn. The language does not require any prior knowledge of basic programming language. Unlike other programming languages including C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into a platform-specific machine. This means a program compiled on one machine can be easily executed on any other machine without making any changes. <br>

Java is multithreaded, meaning multiple tasks can be handled simultaneously and users can construct interactive applications that run smoothly. With its secure features, virus-free, tamper-free systems can be developed. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption. </p>

<h3> HTML </h3>
<p> The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure</p>

<h3> CSS <h3>
<p> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language. </p>
